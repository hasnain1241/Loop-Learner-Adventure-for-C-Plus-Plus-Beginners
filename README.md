# Loop Adventure Game - Learn C++ Loops

Welcome to **Loop Adventure**, a simple interactive game designed to help C++ beginners understand and practice different types of loops in C++: `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops. Each loop is represented as a challenge that players must complete.

## Introduction
Loops are a fundamental concept in programming, allowing you to repeat actions or calculations multiple times with minimal code. This game will introduce you to three types of loops in C++:
- **For loop**
- **While loop**
- **Do-while loop**

## How the Game Works
The game consists of three challenges, each designed to demonstrate the use of a different loop structure:
1. **For Loop Challenge - Forest**: Players must navigate through the forest using a `for loop`.
2. **While Loop Challenge - Wasteland**: Players must survive the wasteland using a `while loop`.
3. **Do-While Loop Challenge - Dungeon**: Players must escape the dungeon using a `do-while loop`.

Once all challenges are completed, you will have a good understanding of how each loop works and when to use them.

## Challenges Overview
1. **For Loop Forest**: Learn how to iterate over a range of numbers with a `for loop`.
2. **While Loop Wasteland**: Explore the conditions under which a `while loop` continues to execute.
3. **Do-While Loop Dungeon**: Understand the difference between a `while loop` and a `do-while loop` by facing a challenge where the action must happen at least once.

## Requirements
To run this game, you need:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or any other IDE that supports C++)
- Basic understanding of how to run C++ programs

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loop-adventure.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd loop-adventure
   ```
3. Compile the program using your C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ -o loop_adventure Loop_Game.cpp
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./loop_adventure
   ```

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this game, you will:
- Understand how a `for loop` works and how to use it for iterations.
- Know how a `while loop` continues executing based on conditions.
- Learn how the `do-while loop` ensures the action is executed at least once.
